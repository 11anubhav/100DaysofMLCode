# Polynomial Linear Regression

In Polynomial Regression, there is only one independent variable but its effect is multi fold with multiple degrees of it affecting the dependent variable.

```
Y = c0 + c1*x1 + c2*x1^2 + c3*x1^3 + ... cN*x1^N
```

**Polynomial Regression is linear because the order of an equation depends upon the unknown values and here co-efficients and not the independent value is unknown.**

**Note:** Polynomial regression is a type of Multi Linear Regression.
