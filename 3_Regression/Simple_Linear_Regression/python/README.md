# Simple Linear Regression in Python

## Part 1 -> Data Pre-Processing

**1. Import the libraries**

**2. Import the Dataset**
* Import dataset in our working directory
* Divide data set into Independent variable matrix (X) and dependent variable matrix (Y)

**3. Split data into test and train set**

```
Note: Significance of Train and Test Data
Machine Learning model learns about co-relations between Independent variable in Train data set with its Dependent variable.
Then, be working on Test Data independent variables, it predicts the dependent variable values.
Then the test data predicted and observed values are compared to check accuracy of the Machine Learning models.
```

**Note: Feature Scaling is not necessary for Simple Linear Regression**
