# Simple Linear Regression

## Introduction

We have a data set having multiple attributes and we want to establish a co-relation amongts each variable.
The simplest data set is one which has only two attribute.
Here, we take a dataset which contains two variables,

1. Years of experience
2. Salary

We want to find the co-relation between above two but we know the default rule of thumb is, 
```
The more is the experience, higher is the expected salary.
```
While this is often true, it depends on the employer, the work you do and many more attributes.

Thus, for accurate prediction, we must populate dataset.

**Most easy way to understand this is in terms of graph between two polar values a,b and y (dependent variable) as a function of independent variables x,y,z ...**
**If the value to be predicted lies between a,b we have a definite analysis but if it goes outside range, we can predict via EXTRAPOLATION**
