## Data Pre-processing

Data pre-processing is the pre-requisite to successful running of machine learning algorithms.

## Download Data sets

Link to [data set](https://www.superdatascience.com/pages/machine-learning).

**Note: Data sets are generally .csv files (Comma separated files).** 
Generally, .csv files first row consists of variables (attributes).
There are two types of attributes:

**1. Independent variables**
**2. Dependent variables**

We are presented with data values for independent variables and using our Machine learning algorithms, we have to predict the dependent variables.

## Importing Libraries
Libraries consists of pre-built functions that take user input and give desired output.

## 1. Importing Libraries in Python

Three essential libraries:

**1. numpy:** For mathematical functions
**2. matplotlib.pyplot:** Creating charts for visualization
**3. pandas:** to import and manage data sets

**How to import library in python**
```python
import libary as alias;
```

## 2. Importing Libraries in R

Can be imported via GUI package explorer in RStudio. Generally all basic libraries we need are automatically imported.
