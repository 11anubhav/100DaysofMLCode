## Data Pre-processing

Data pre-processing is the pre-requisite to successful running of machine learning algorithms.

**Note: Data sets are generally .csv files (Comma separated files).** 
Generally, .csv files first row consists of variables (attributes).
There are two types of attributes:

**1. Independent variables**
**2. Dependent variables**

We are presented with data values for independent variables and using our Machine learning algorithms, we have to predict the dependent variables.
