## K-Means Clustering

### Introduction
K-Means is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. The algorithm divides the data points into k groups (called clusters), where each data point can belong to only one cluster. K-Means aims to group together similar data points into the same cluster, while keeping different clusters as far apart as possible. 

Each cluster has a center, which is a data point that represents the center of the cluster. A data point gets added to a cluster whose center is closest to that data point. Distance between points is measures using sum of squared distances method.
